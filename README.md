# 🧠 SQL Mastery: From Basics to Advanced

Welcome to the **SQL Mastery Repository**, a complete walkthrough of essential and advanced SQL concepts. This repo is built to help you **learn, practice, and master SQL** as used in real-world data engineering, analytics, and business environments.

---

## 📘 Overview

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for managing and analyzing data in relational databases. In most organizations, SQL is at the heart of roles like:

- 📊 Data Analysts
- 🧮 Financial Analysts
- 🛠️ Data Engineers
- 🔍 Risk Managers
- 🧠 Business Intelligence Developers

This repository guides you through how SQL is used across the data pipeline—from **querying** and **transforming data**, to **optimizing performance** and **building scalable data models**.

## 🔄 Real-World Data Flow

A typical real-world SQL workflow looks like:

1. Analysts write complex queries to extract insights.
2. Engineers extract, transform, and load (ETL) data into warehouses.
3. Stakeholders access data through dashboards and views.
4. Performance, maintainability, and security are top concerns.

## 💡 Challenges in SQL Projects

- Code Redundancy
- Performance Bottlenecks
- Query Complexity
- Maintenance Difficulty
- Database Stress
- Security Concerns

## ✅ Smart SQL Techniques Covered

| Technique     | Purpose                                                   |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Subqueries    | Break complex queries into manageable logic blocks         |
| CTEs          | Improve readability and reuse of logic                     |
| Views         | Create virtual tables for abstraction and security         |
| Temp Tables   | Store intermediate results temporarily                     |
| CTAS          | Create physical tables from SQL queries for performance    |
| Stored Procedures | Encapsulate logic with parameters and error handling |

## 🔍 Topics Breakdown

### 1. 🧩 Subqueries
- Scalar, Row, Table subqueries
- Subqueries in `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`
- Use of `IN`, `EXISTS`, `ANY`, `ALL`

### 2. 🔗 CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Standalone, Nested, Multiple CTEs
- Recursive CTEs (e.g., sequences, hierarchy)
- Improves modularity and readability

### 3. 🪞 Views
- Virtual tables without storing data
- Useful for security and abstraction
- Ideal for BI tools and data access layers

### 4. 💽 CTAS (Create Table As Select)
- Create snapshot tables
- Optimizing large queries
- Useful for ETL and data mart creation

### 5. ⏳ Temp Tables
- Store intermediate results
- Used in multi-step transformations
- Cleared automatically after session/query

### 6. ⚙️ Stored Procedures
- Reusable scripts for automation
- Parameters, variables, and control flow
- Error handling with `TRY...CATCH`
- Encapsulates business logic securely

| **Storage**     | Memory   | Memory  | Disk       | Disk    | Virtual |
| **Lifetime**    | Temporary| Temporary | Session  | Permanent| Permanent |
| **Scope**       | One Query| One Query| Multiple Queries | Multiple | Multiple |
| **Reusability** | Low      | Medium  | Medium     | High    | High    |
| **Up-to-Date**  | Yes      | Yes     | No         | No      | Yes     |
