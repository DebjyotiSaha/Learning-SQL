## üß± **CTAS ‚Äì Create Table As Select**

CTAS is a powerful SQL feature used to create a **new table** and **populate it with the result of a query** in a single step.

---

### üîß **Syntax**

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name AS
(
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM existing_table
    WHERE condition
);
```

OR using `SELECT INTO` (commonly used in SQL Server):

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
INTO new_table
FROM existing_table
WHERE condition;
```

### üìå **Comparison: CTAS vs. Traditional Table Creation**

| Feature        | Traditional Method                    | CTAS                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Table Creation | `CREATE TABLE` with column definition | `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` or `SELECT INTO` |
| Data Insertion | Requires separate `INSERT` statement  | Automatically inserts data                |
| Flexibility    | More control over structure           | Faster, but dependent on SELECT           |

### ‚úÖ **Use Cases**

#### 1. üöÄ **Performance Optimization**

Create pre-aggregated tables to improve query performance in dashboards and reports.

```sql
SELECT DATENAME(MONTH, created_date) AS OrderMonth,
       COUNT(userid) AS TotalOrders
INTO dbo.MonthlyOrders
FROM sales
GROUP BY DATENAME(MONTH, created_date);
```

#### 2. üì∏ **Snapshot / Physical Data Mart**

Create a **point-in-time snapshot** of a dataset that may change frequently.

* Useful for **month-end** or **quarterly** data freezes.

#### 3. üîÅ **Refreshing Tables (Recreate Strategy)**

Replace an old version of a table by dropping and recreating it.

```sql
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.MonthlyOrders', 'U') IS NOT NULL
    DROP TABLE dbo.MonthlyOrders;

SELECT DATENAME(MONTH, created_date) AS OrderMonth,
       COUNT(userid) AS TotalOrders
INTO dbo.MonthlyOrders
FROM sales
GROUP BY DATENAME(MONTH, created_date);
```

#### 4. üß™ **Temporary Analysis**

CTAS is ideal when you want to perform:

* What-if analysis
* Intermediate data prep
* Debugging and inspection

You can use a **temporary table** with `#` or `##` (in SQL Server):

```sql
SELECT * 
INTO #TempAnalysis 
FROM sales 
WHERE product_id = 5;
```

### üß© **Benefits of CTAS**

* Simplifies ETL and data pipeline stages
* Reduces code duplication
* Supports physical layer for reporting
* Great for archiving historical slices
