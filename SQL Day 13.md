FROM pizza_sales;
```

**2. Hardcoded Date:**

```sql
SELECT order_id, order_time, '2015-12-12' AS HardCoded 
FROM pizza_sales;

## ðŸ§° **Functions Overview**

### ðŸ§© Part Extraction

* `DAY()`, `MONTH()`, `YEAR()` â€“ Return day, month, year respectively

```sql
SELECT order_id, order_date,
       YEAR(order_date) AS Year,
       MONTH(order_date) AS Month,
       DAY(order_date) AS Day
FROM pizza_sales;
```

* `DATEPART()` â€“ Extract numeric parts (year, month, hour, quarter, etc.)

```sql
SELECT order_id, order_date, order_time,
       DATEPART(YEAR, order_date) AS Year,
       DATEPART(HOUR, order_time) AS Hour,
       DATEPART(QUARTER, order_date) AS Quarter
FROM pizza_sales;
```

* `DATENAME()` â€“ Returns string representation (e.g. "February", "Monday")

```sql
SELECT order_id, DATENAME(MONTH, order_date) AS MonthName,
       DATENAME(WEEKDAY, order_date) AS DayName
FROM pizza_sales;
```

* `DATETRUNC()` â€“ Truncates datetime to a specified part (e.g. DAY, MINUTE)

```sql
SELECT order_id,
       DATETRUNC(DAY, order_date) AS StartOfDay,
       DATETRUNC(MINUTE, order_time) AS StartOfMinute
FROM pizza_sales;
```

* `EOMONTH()` â€“ Returns end of month

```sql
SELECT order_id, EOMONTH(order_date) AS EndOfMonth
FROM pizza_sales;
```

## ðŸ“Š **Data Aggregation Examples**

* **Orders by Year:**

```sql
SELECT YEAR(order_date) AS Year, COUNT(*) AS OrderCount
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY YEAR(order_date);
```

* **Orders by Month:**

```sql
SELECT MONTH(order_date) AS Month, COUNT(*) AS OrderCount
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY MONTH(order_date);
```

* **Orders in February:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM pizza_sales
WHERE MONTH(order_date) = 2;
```
